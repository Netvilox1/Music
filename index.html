  <h2 class="w3-wide">THE BAND</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We love music</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">We have created a fictional band website. Please tell us a bit about yourself and how you started off music as a group?

Bracket is made up of two young men with the stage names: VAST and SMASH. VAST: real name is Ozioko Nwachukwu from Enugu State in Nsukka local government area. I am a 200-level student of the Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu, Enugu State studying Mass Communication. I am the fifth son of a family of six and I am single. SMASH: real name is Ali Obumneme from Enugu State. I am a student of University of Nigeria, Nsukka studying psychology, 300 level student and I am single. (Laughing)

What did you do before ‘Yori Yori’; were you into entertainment of any sort?

Yes, we were into entertainment, <a href="https://sitedownornot.org/domain/music.com">music</a> to be precise and in case you do not know we had an album named Happy day although it did not go as far as this recent one even though the album was equally good.

Did you have any fears about your music being accepted and reckoned with?

Bracket are artistes who never lost hope no matter what obstacles came their way.

How did you feel with the blow up of your song ‘Yori Yori’?

Hmm. Honestly, we were anxious and our hearts keep missing beats each time we compare the days of Yori Yori and the days of Happy day. It is still like a dream. I mean before people liked our songs in Happy day. But they did not buy it. But it is a different ball game. They not only buy it, but we get to perform at shows. We feel on top of the world and that’s why we can’t stop saying thanks to God Almighty

Do you have any other songs asides ‘Yori Yori’?

We have eight other interesting from songs apart from Yori Yori. You need to check out the album.

What are they about?

In the album, we have songs that will inspire you positively; songs that are of love for kids and adults in a positive way too and some serious party songs.

Why is ‘Yori Yori’ the only popular one; are the others not as interesting?

We have the likes of ‘No time’ ft P-square, ‘Ada Owerri’ ft J. Martins while the others are catch up. seriously, if you don’t have the album, you are missing out. (Laughing)

How are you finding the Nigerian entertainment industry? Has it been fair and kind to you?

The Nigerian entertainment industry has been fair and kind to us because, now in <a href="https://Prostats.org/site/nigeria.com">Nigeria</a> people appreciate songs sang by Nigerians. People now pay money to watch their favourite artiste perform his or her own song. This is a great sign for us.

What are your fans like to you?
I love the <a href="https://9jahob.com/tag/phyno">Phyno Songs</a> tilted The Bag! 

Now our fans are like our mentors, they inspire us every day. I don’t think we can do without them because with their support we will make more hits.

One of your fans says she was attracted by your voices. She would like to know what you do to make it this sweet sounding.

Our voice is a gift from God, it natural.

You are described as another of your fans as Nigerian Akons. Do you agree?

The only truth is that Akon is one of our mentors, we love him and the kind of music he does but we don’t sound alike. We have this flavour in our songs that anytime you listen to them and hear our voices, you will always know that it is Bracket.

What inspires the lyrics of your songs?

We get inspired from daily activities of the day, we write about reality, what we see is what we sing about and we write and compose our songs our selves.

What next for Bracket?

For now the next thing for Bracket is the music video which will soon be out on air. The song is No time ft P-square you can also download it on <a href="https://tooxclusive.com/">Tooxclusive</a>.</section>
